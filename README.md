# rimd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicklan/rimd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicklan/rimd)

rimd is a set of utilities to deal with midi messages and standard
midi files (SMF).  It handles both standard midi messages and the meta
messages that are found in SMFs.

rimd is fairly low level, and  messages are stored and accessed in
their underlying format (i.e. a vector of `u8`s).  There are some
utility methods for accessing the various pieces of a message, and
for constructing new messages.

For a description of the underlying format of midi messages see [here](http://www.midi.org/techspecs/midimessages.php)
For a description of the underlying format of meta messages see [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150217154504/http://cs.fit.edu/~ryan/cse4051/projects/midi/midi.html#meta-events)
